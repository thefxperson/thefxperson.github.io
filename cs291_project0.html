    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>On average, how many requests can ab complete in 10 seconds with all the power of two concurrency levels between 1 and 256 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256)?</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <td>Concurrency Level</td>
          <td>Number of Requests</td>

    <p>Why are there diminishing returns at higher concurrency levels?</p>
    <p>At higher concurrency levels, the number of requests likely is overwhelming the server, or the server is rate limiting the benchmarking tool.</p>
    <p>What’s the performance difference when requesting HTTP and HTTPS?</p>
    <p>Requesting HTTPS is approximately half as efficient as requesting via HTTP. For 16 concurrent HTTPS requests, GitHub completed 2775, 44% of the number completed via HTTP.</p>
    <p>How can github respond so quickly?</p>
    <p>GitHub can quickly respond due to having multiple servers to process requests. Their servers likely cache recent requests, which allows a rapid respose without having to fetch the resources from slow storage again</p>
    <p>What is your site’s “Time to Interactive” according to PageSpeed Insights?</p>
    <p>0.8 seconds</p>
